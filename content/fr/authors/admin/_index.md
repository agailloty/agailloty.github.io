My name is Axel. I live in this beautiful country we call France. 
I have a Master Degree in Applied Economics with major in Econometrics and Statistics. 
I am in general interested in solving problems. What I like the most is the heuristic in problem solving. 

Whether it be Economics problems such as Game Theory or coding challenges I love it when I am pushed to my limits. 

I currently work as a Sofware Engineer in a consulting company based in Nantes, West France. 
I intervene as a C#/.NET developer for large companies where I help building robust, resilient and reliable software for various applications. 
I am at ease using WPF with the MVVM pattern for building desktop softwares (I keep on eye on the new .NET MAUI) ans with ASP.NET MVC and Blazor. 

My journey in coding started in 2017 when I first encountered the R programming language for statistics and econometric courses. I remeber using the FactoMiner and Rcmdr packages
for PCA, MCA and Hierarchical clustering. It was a whole new world that reveals itself to me. I decided this same year to learn programming. 

A year later,  out of curiosity I deciced to buy José Portilla course on Data Science and Machine learning using Python on Udemy. I discovered Python syntax and fell in love with it. 

For many years I've used extensively both languages both for academic purposes and personal projects. Rmarkdown and Jupyter Notebook where my friends and I loved it when my teachers asked me how I could make these beautiful visualizations in my projects. 

As time evolved my interested for building production grade softwares show up. With both R and Python people can build useful applications but I found them not so popular in large companies. Python has a better appreciation for Machine Learning and scripting than R but in general they lack some features that languages such as Java, C#, C++ or Go have that is performance and scalability. 

That's why I decided to open up to C#. 

Ideally I'd like to work on a project which involves both Data and sofware development. A scenario I'll really appreciate is to build a solid web app with ASP.NET and Blazor that leverages Python's machine learning capabilities. 

You can find me on LinkedIn and Twitter.
