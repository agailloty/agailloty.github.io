summary: xpathrunner is an application developed in C# to evaluate Xpath expressions on an HTML or XML document. Originally developed for web mining protyping. The application is currently shipped as command line utility, I am working to make it available natively on Linux, MacOs and Windows and in the browser in WASM thanks to Avalonia UI
