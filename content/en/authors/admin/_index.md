Self-taught and curious, my interests are software development and data science.
I particularly like working with Microsoft technologies: .NET, WPF, Avalonia UI, Blazor and ASP.NET.
I am currently working as a .NET/C# consultant. I help companies develop new applications and maintain existing applications in C# with .NET Framework or .NET Core. I am comfortable with C# and VB.NET and Python languages. I speak French and English.
